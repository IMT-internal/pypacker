pypacker
========

General information
-------------------

This is pypacker: The fast, simple packet creation and parsing lib for Python.

What you can do with pypacker:
	- Read packets (eg via pcap) and analyze all aspects of it. It's as easy as:

	import pypacker
	f = open('packets.pcap','rb')
	pcap = dpkt.pcap.Reader(f)
	for ts, buf in pcap:
		print("TS: %s LEN: %d" % (ts, len(buf))
		ether = Ethernet(buf)
		ip = ether.data
		tcp = ip.data
		http = pypacker.Http(tcp.data)
		if http.method == "GET":
			print("got GET-request for: %s", % http.uri)

	Protocols up to the transport-layer are decoded automatically.
	Higher-level protocols like HTTP need to be manually instatiated
	because there is generally no information about them in the lower layers.

	- Create Packets giving specific values or take the defaults. It's as easy as:

	ip = IP(src='\x01\x02\x03\x04', dst='\x05\x06\x07\x08', p=1)
	icmp = ICMP(type=8, data=ICMP.Echo(id=123, seq=1, data='foobar'))
	ip.data = icmp
	ip.len += len(ip.data)

	  Those can be resent using pcap, raw sockets etc.


What you can NOT do with it:
	Pypacker is not as full-blown feature-rich as other packet-analyzer
	like Scapy, so you can't autoamtically create neat graphics out of
	TCP-sequence-numbers, use it as a port-scanner, fingerprint servers
	or use it as a fuzzer by writing one line of code. Those kind of
	features can easy be written using open-source tools like gnuplot
	and very few lines of python-code.

FAQ

Q:	How much does pypacker cost?
A:	Pypacker is a free software - you can download it without paying any license fee.
	The version you download is not a demo version, with limitations not present in
	a full version - it's the full version. The license under which pypacker is
	issued is the BSD License. See LICENCE and http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php
	for more information.

Q:	Are there any plans to support [protocol xyz]?
A:	Support for particular protocols is added to pypacker as a result of people contributing
	that support - no formal plans for adding support for particular protocols in particular
	future releases exist. 

Q:	Is there any documentation?
A:	pypacker is based on code of dpkt, which in turn didn't have any official or internal
	code documentation. This makes understanding for the internal behaviour pretty hard.
	After all adding more documentation is one point on the TODO-list.

Q:	There is problem xyz with pypacker using windows 3.11/XP/7/8. Can you fix that?
A:	No. There will be no windows suppoert.
