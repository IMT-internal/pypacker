Styleguide
----------

- zero'd checksum fields should be computed and set in __str__()

- length fields should not be set except manually (maybe automatically
in set_data() methods?)

- set_data() should do nice length field, zero'd checksum, named member,
etc. fixups like the unpacking constructor... maybe later

- All official Python style-guidelines should be applied except the
preference of space-characters. Tabs must be used throughout
the code:

	GLOBAL_XYZ[tab]= 123[tab]# some comment

	class someclass()
	# some comment
		[tab]def xyz(self):
		[tab]# Some comment
			[tab][tab]var1 = 123[tab]# some comment
			[tab][tab]pass

- String are written using double quotes like "string_xyz".

- python upgrade to version 3.x:
	minor changes are ignored for backward-compatibility (2.x -> 3.x):
	for k,v in xyz.items()	->	for k,v in list(xyz.items())


Adding protocols
----------------

New rptocols are added by subclassing "Packet" and placing them into the
right "layerX"-directory. Protocol-header are defined using the static
field "__hdr__". See code documentation for classes "MetaPacket" and
"Packet" in pypacker/pypacker.py for detailed information.
